# Where We Droppin' Boys?
This extremely common question has plagued friend groups and random parties alike since the release of Fortnite. I intend to eliminate this question once and for all through this substantially over-engineered codebase.  

### Usage
1. Ensure you have the proper required packages in you python environment:  
  `pip install -r requirments.txt`  ~~(hint: there aren't any)~~
2. Run the program:  
  `python3 droplocation.py`
